# Advanced Node concepts

This project explores much about how the internals of
Node work. It's a follow-along to Stephen Grider's
Node JS: Advanced concepts course. Here, I begin
to understand the eventloop, libuv and v8 as running under Node, and how to improve performance through caching and cluster mode

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Running Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver standard image
Visit ubuntu.com to get the latest image.
Google how to install the iso.
(iso on USB through UniversalUSB installer works.)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
Node
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
node -v
'check what version you have'
```

```

```

Demo
```

```
