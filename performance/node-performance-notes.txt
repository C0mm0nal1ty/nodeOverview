----------------------------------------------------------
Node runs a single thread for the event loop.
Downsides?
Nothing else can be run while functions,calls are being run in the
event loop.

What is clustering in theory?
general definition - group of similar objects
definition - in clustering, a cluster manager monitors a
cluster(group) of individual node applications running.

Cluster manager doesn't handle requests; it only monitors
the health of each individual instance of the node server

What happens when we start using clustering in Node?
You run node index.js, the index.js is sent to the cluster
manager, it calls the cluster.fork() to create a worker instance
then sends it to the worker instance to process.

How does cluster manager decide what to do with the file?
It forks a child instance to handle the node instance,
then run the index code.

----------------------------------------------------------
Implementing a cluster.
Use the cluster.fork() to manage instances of a node running.
In index.js, the cluster manager forks a child instance.
If there are 4 fork calls, 4 instances are spun to handle the requests
coming in.

----------------------------------------------------------
Benchmarking the app before clustering?
First, we need to benchmark performance.
Follow the tests in the README.md file to benchmark using the
apache utilities

Downside to clustering?
Clustering stretches the performance of CPU to thin. By
the CPU having to address ALL the results SIMULTANEOUSLY,
it caused a performance cost.
THE MORE CHILDS, THE LONGER THE RESPONSE TIME.

FIND THE BALANCE IN BETWEEN WITH NOT TOO MANY CHILDS
AND NOT TOO LESS.

----------------------------------------------------------
Library with the best cluster manager AKA load balancer?
PM2 - https://github.com/Unitech/pm2

Piece of software used in production deployments. It will
manage child instances that crash.

----------------------------------------------------------
Node performance with worker threads?
Worker threads are still an experimental feature.
Worker threads use a threadpool.

How does worker threads work?
In our single thread in the event loop. the worker threads
package will manage a worker interface. It will offload
calculations to a worker through a postmessage and an onmessage.

Our App
-> worker interface (communicates with postMessage and onmessage)
-> worker, that communicates with worker interface (
again with postMessage and onmessage
)
